# Warp creation (/setwarp)
warp_created=You created warp {warp.name} at x: {warp.location.x}, y: {warp.location.y}, z: {warp.location.z}, yaw: {warp.location.yaw}, pitch: {warp.location.pitch}!
warp_creation->warp_exist=Warp named {warp.name} already exists, choose a different name with /setwarp <name>
warp_creation->illegal_location=Our military grade algorithms have concluded that this location is not safe for use! Warp creation was canceled.

# Warp removal (/delwarp)
warp_removed=You removed warp {warp.name} at x: {warp.location.x}, y: {warp.location.y}, z: {warp.location.z}, yaw: {warp.location.yaw}, pitch: {warp.location.pitch}!
warp_removal->warp_not_existing=Warp named {warp.name} does not exists, see you warps with command /listwarps
warp_removal->not_owner=You are not the owner of {warp.name} so you cannot remove it!

# Warp moving (/movewarp)
warp_moved=You moved warp {warp.name} to x: {warp.location.x}, y: {warp.location.y}, z: {warp.location.z}, yaw: {warp.location.yaw}, pitch: {warp.location.pitch}!
warp_moving->warp_not_existing=Warp named {warp.name} does not exists, see you warps with command /listwarps
warp_moving->not_owner=You are not the owner of {warp.name} so you cannot remove it!
